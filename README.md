# 👋🏾 Baffour Kwabena Gyimah  
**Environmental Management MSc | Sustainability Analyst | Junior Developer in Training (Node, Express, EJS, JS)**

I’m an Environmental Management graduate with hands-on experience in sustainability research, solar PV performance analysis, carbon metrics, and stakeholder engagement. Alongside this, I’m deliberately transitioning into software development by learning full-stack fundamentals and building real, functional projects.

My strongest project so far is a **To-Do App built with Node.js, Express, and EJS**, demonstrating server-side rendering, routing, and dynamic data handling.
